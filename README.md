Projects completed during btech



PEST control device

Objective: Pest and rodent control in areas difficult for human operation.
Microcontroller: Central processing unit of the device.
Sensors: PIR module detects pests and rodents.
Actuators:
                  Ultrasonic transducers emit ultrasonic waves to deter pests.
                  Solenoid valves release toxic gases to neutralize larger pests.
                  Operation: Upon detection, actuators activate to control pests effectively.



Security_robot


Objective: Designed a robot to monitor school corridors and halls during night hours.
Path Following: Follows a predetermined path for surveillance.
Security Alert System: Alerts security in case of any mishappening.
Sensors:
                  Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect obstacles.
                  PIR Sensors: Detect human presence.
Microcontroller: ESP32 used for processing and Wi-Fi connectivity.
Remote Monitoring: Security can monitor accumulated data in real time via Wi-Fi.



Overflow_detection


Objective: Implemented a system to save water in a residential building with multiple water tanks.
Problem Addressed: Uneven water consumption across floors makes it difficult to fill tanks separately.
System Components:
          Ultrasonic Sensors: Deployed in 4 different water tanks to monitor water levels.
          Arduino Uno: Central controller for processing sensor data.
          Buzzer: Activates when all ultrasonic sensors detect water crossing a predetermined 
          level.
Functionality: Alerts residents when water reaches a set threshold, preventing overflow and ensuring efficient water management.



Theft_detection


Objective: Implemented a theft detection module for household security, especially for lockers.
Functionality: Prevents break-in attempts in secure and private areas.
Components Used: ESP32 Microcontroller PIR Sensor
Data Transmission: Sensor data is sent to the cloud for processing.
If the detected value crosses a threshold, the user receives a break-in attempt notification 



Speech_recognition


Cross-Correlation: Used for speech pattern matching and recognition.
Template Matching & Pattern Recognition: Enabled effective identification of speech signals. Performance Evaluation: Measured accuracy and reliability using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER).



GPS_enabled_smart_lock_system


Objective: Deploy a smart lock for logistics to provide high security and tracking
Functionality: Send alerts to the server when brute force is used to damage the lock, provides live coordinates of the lock
components used: proximity sensors, gps module, microcontrollers, vibration sensor, keypad, LCD.
Novelty: works on 2 factors of authentication i.e OTP and the coordinated of the lock should match with the coordinates of the destination prefeeded
